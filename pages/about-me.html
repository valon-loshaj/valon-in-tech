		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			Hey there!  üëã I'm Valon, a software developer with a passion for building software applications that are both powerful and user-friendly. I love the challenge of taking complex problems and crafting elegant solutions, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skillset.
		</p>
		<p>
			My journey into tech was a bit unconventional.  I actually started out in hospitality and then retail, but my fascination with technology eventually led me to the world of software development. Thinking back to when I write my first lines of code in middle school to build a small catapult game...Yeah, that was the beginning of it all! üòÑ.  I'm mostly self-taught, which has given me a unique perspective and a deep appreciation for the power of continuous learning.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've spent the last few years immersed in the world of designing and building enterprise applications, focusing on creating seamless and efficient solutions that make a real difference. I've had the privilege of working on everything from end-to-end user experiences to high-performance APIs, always with an eye on scalability, reliability, and user satisfaction.  My experience in tech consulting has allowed me to hone my skills in systems design, object-oriented programming, and crafting impactful, quality-driven software solutions across a variety of industries, including retail, telecommunications, hospitality, and health and life sciences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of the technical stuff, when I'm not glued to my computer, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, getting lost in a good book, or trying my hand at woodworking (with varying degrees of success!).  I'm also a big fan of travel and experiencing new cultures.  ‚úàÔ∏è
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm a big believer in collaboration, open communication, and a kind-hearted approach to everything I do.  If you're interested in the latest in software development, want to swap travel stories, or just chat about the joys (and frustrations!) of woodworking, feel free to reach out!  I'm always excited to connect with fellow tech enthusiasts and learn from others.
		</p>
