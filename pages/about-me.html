        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Since February 2021, I've been diving deep into the world of designing large-scale enterprise applications, focusing on creating seamless and efficient solutions that make a real difference.
            At the heart of my approach is a blend of technical mastery and creative problem-solving. I've had the privilege of building end-to-end user experiences and high-performance APIs, always with
            an eye on scalability, reliability, and user satisfaction. My time in tech consulting has solidified my skills in systems design, object-oriented programming, and the art of crafting 
            impactful, quality-driven software solutions. Over the years I've worked on varying tech stacks across multiple industries including retail, telecommunications, hospitality, and more recently
            in health and life sciences.

            A bit about me beyond the screen? Originating from Eastern Europe and raised in the amazing city of NYC, my fascination with technology began early, sparked by my first foray into programming
            with a simple BASIC-coded game in middle school. When I'm not immersed in the tech world, I'm an avid hiker, traveler, reader, and a budding woodworker. These hobbies offer me a refreshing 
            escape, providing balance and inspiration for my professional endeavors.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey into tech was a bit unconventional, transitioning into tech without a formal CS degree. My knowledge of coding and software architecture came from a ton of self learning and great
            self-paced learning resources. I'm a 19X Certified Salesforce Technical Architect, with certifications like Salesforce Certified Platform Developer I and II, and Salesforce Certified 
            JavaScript Developer under my belt. Additionally, I hold MuleSoft Certified Platform Architect (MCPS) and Developer (MCPD) certifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe in the power of collaboration, effective communication, and a kind-hearted approach to both professional and personal interactions. Driven by a passion for technology and a 
            commitment to continuous learning and improvement, I'm always excited to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new horizons in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
