# valon-in-tech
This repository is for my personal site, version 0.0.0. 
## Design
The website's goal is to serve as an introduction to myself and provide a jumping off point to my projects, blog, and a means of contacting me. I wanted the site to be minimal without too many bells and whistles. The site is also meant to serve as a project that I can tinker with when I see something on the internet that I would like to try on my own project.
## Build
There is no fancy framework here, just good ol' HTML, JS and CSS. The initial version of the website is very minimal, and contains many 'under construction' pages. I intend to get these pages up and running in the next 3-6 weeks but I intend to make these pages their own applications by utilizing other technologies (such as Next.js, React.js and others).
## Hosting
I thought about the different options for hosting the website, and I came to the decision of putting it on Netlify. Netlify provided a really simple portal that was able to get me up and running in a really short amount of time with barely any friction. The other thing that I really liked about Netflify was the built in domain registering which allowed me to register my domain all without leaving the Netflify portal. And to round it all out, it was also a pretty cheap option, I'm currently on the free tier and haven't ran into any blockers just yet. I initially tried to host my page on Heroku (future blog post on this coming) but ran into quite a few challenges, mainly because it wasn't really the right tool for what I was trying to do.
## Next Steps
My backlog for this site is not too crazy. The below two things are what I'm planning on doing next:
1. Build out the blog page
    a. The blog app will be using Next.js and React.js (I've been itching to expirement with server rendered components)
    b. The blog will be a subdomain of the website (blog.valonintech.dev)
    c. Content repository for the blog posts
2. Build out the projects page
    a. The projects app will be built using Astro.js (Another itch I've been wanting to scratch)
    b. This will also be a subdomain of the website (projects.valonintech.dev)
    c. Content repository for the projects
